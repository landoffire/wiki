Terranite Ore
=============

Terranite Ore is a soft, non-conducting, mineral substance which is refined and used in armor or weaponry, depending upon the process used in refining. 

One method, used in weaponry, replaces the weak matrix (which gives the ore its characteristic softness) with a hardening mixture of carbon and several rare minerals. This gives the resulting terranite weaponry an incredibly strong edge, much stronger than that of steel.

The other method, generally used in armor, keeps the weak matrix, but purifies it greatly. This is done with great heat, but also with extreme pressure, which has the useful side-effect of strengthening the matrix in the direction of compression. This gives the excellent one-way protection required for armor. But more importantly, the weak matrix is what gives Terranite Ore its high non-conducting properties. Thus this method gives the armor good insulation against tech attacks, which property is sorely lacking in traditional steel-based equipment.

Terranite Ore is also technically edible, but is high value, cardboard-like flavor, teeth-rotting properties, and mediocre food value all combine to make Terranite foodstuffs nonexistent.
